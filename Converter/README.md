## 🛠️ Description
A simple converter app built in Python. Now supports both command-line and graphical user interface (GUI) modes with PyQt5 or Tkinter.

## ⚙️ Languages or Frameworks Used
- Python 3
- PyQt5 (for modern GUI)
- Tkinter (for classic GUI)

## 🌟 How to run
Open a terminal in the folder where your script is located and run one of the following commands:

**For the classic command-line converter:**
```sh
python converter.py
```

**For the GUI version (choose PyQt5 or Tkinter):**
```sh
python converter_gui.py
```
You will be prompted to select which GUI you prefer (`pyqt5` or `tkinter`).

- If you choose `pyqt5`, make sure you have PyQt5 installed:
  ```sh
  pip install pyqt5
  ```
- If you choose `tkinter`, it is included with most Python installations by default.
